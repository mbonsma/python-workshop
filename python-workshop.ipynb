    "- Computing is about humans communicating with the computer to modulate flows of current in the hardware, in order to get the computer to carry out advanced calculations that we are unable to efficiently compute ourselves. \n",
    "- Early examples of human-computer communication included actually disconnecting a wire and connecting it again in a different spot. \n",
    "- Today we usually use graphical user interfaces with menus and buttons. These graphical interfaces can be thought of as a layer or shell around the internal components of your operating system making it easier for us to express our thoughts and for computers to interpret them.\n",
    "- An example of a graphical user interface is spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. Here, all the functionality of the program is accessible via hierarchical menus, and clicking buttons sends instructions to the computer, which then responds and sends the results back to your screen.\n",
    "- Spreadsheet software is great for viewing and entering small data sets and creating simple visualizations fast. However, it can be tricky to design publication-ready figures, create automatic reproducible analysis workflows, perform advanced calculations, and reliably clean data sets. Even when using a spreadsheet program to record data, it is often beneficial to have some some basic programming skills to facilitate the analyses of those data."

    "### Advantages of text-based communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will communicate with our computers via text rather than graphical point and click. Typing instructions to the computer might at first seem counterintuitive and unnecessarily difficult. While graphical user interfaces can be nice when you are new to something, text-based interfaces are more powerful, faster and actually also easier to use once you get comfortable with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about learning a language: in the beginning it's nice to look things up in a dictionary (or a menu in a graphical program), and slowly string together sentences one word at a time. But once we become more proficient in the language and know what we want to say, it is easier to say or type it directly, instead of having to look up every word in the dictionary first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text interfaces are also less resource-intensive than their graphical counterparts and easier to develop programs for since you don't have to code the graphical components. It is also much easier to automate and repeat any task once you have all the instructions written down. This facilitates reproducibility of analysis, not only between studies from different labs, but also between researchers in the same lab: compare being shown how to perform a certain analysis in spreadsheet software, where the instruction will essentially be \"first you click here, then here, then here...\", with being handed the same workflow written down in several lines of codes which you can analyse and understand at your own pace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since text is the easiest way for people who are fluent in computer languages to interact with computers, many powerful programs are written without a graphical user interface (which makes it faster to create these programs) and to use these programs you often need to know how to use a text interface. For example, many of the best data analysis and machine learning packages are written in Python or R, and you need to know these languages to use them. Even if the program or package you want to use is not written in Python, much of the knowledge you gain from understanding one programming language can be transferred to others. In addition, most powerful computers that you can log into remotely might only give you a text interface to work with and there is no way to launch a graphical user interface."

Since its inception, the scope of the project expanded to include additional programming languages, such as Julia, Python, and R, so the name was changed to \"Jupyter\" as a reference to these core languages. Today, Jupyter supports many more languages, but we will be using it only for Python code. Specifically, we will be using the notebook from Jupyter, which allows us to easily take notes about our analysis and view plots within the same document where we code. This facilitates sharing and reproducibility of analyses, and the notebook interface is easily accessible through any web browser as well as exportable as a PDF or HTML page.\n",

All charts are in one menu, text layout tools in another, data analyses tools in a third, and so on. Programming languages such as Python have so many tools and functions so that they would not fit in a menu. Instead of clicking `File -> Open` and chose the file, you would type something similar to `file.open('<filename>')` in a programming language.

    "Since there are so many functions available in Python, it is unnecessary to include all of them with the default installation of the programming language (it would be as if your new phone came with every single app preinstalled). Instead, more advanced functionality is grouped into separate packages, which can be accessed by typing `import <package_name>` in Python. You can think of this as that you are telling the program which menu items you want to activate (similar to how Excel hides the `Developer menu` by default since most people rarely use it and you need activate it in the settings if you want to access its functionality). The Anaconda Python distribution essentially bundles the core Python language with many of the most effective Python packages for data analysis, but some packages need to be downloaded before they can be used, just like downloading an addon to a browser or mobile phone.\n",

Luckily, in the Jupyter Notebook, you can type `numpy.`<kbd>Tab</kbd> (that is numpy + period + tab-key) and a small menu will pop up that shows you all the available functions in that module. This is analogous to clicking a 'numpy-menu' and then going through the list of functions. As I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of available functions and it can be helpful to filter the menu by typing the initial letters of the function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more info on the function you want to use, you can type out the full name and then press <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> once to bring up a help dialogue and again to expand that dialogue. We can see that to use this function, we need to supply it with the argument `a`, which should be 'array-like'. An array is essentially just a sequence of numbers. We just saw that one way of doing this was to enclose numbers in brackets `[]`, which in Python means that these numbers are in a list, something you will hear more about later. Instead of manually activating the menu every time, the JupyterLab  offers a tool called the \"Inspector\" which displays help information automatically. I find this very useful and always have it open next to my Notebook. More help is available via the \"Help\" menu, which links to useful online resources (for example `Help --> Numpy Reference`).\n",

    "This is how a data frame is displayed in the JupyterLab Notebook. Although the data frame itself just consists of the values, the Notebook knows that this is a data frame and displays it in a nice tabular format (by adding HTML decorators), and adds some cosmetic conveniences such as the bold font type for the column and row names, the alternating grey and white zebra stripes for the rows and highlights the row the mouse pointer moves over. The increasing numbers on the far left is the data frame's index, which was added by `pandas` to easily distinguish between the rows.\n",

    "A data frame is the representation of data in a tabular format, similar to how data is often arranged in spreadsheets. The data is rectangular, meaning that all rows have the same amount of columns and all columns have the same amount of rows. Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and plotting. A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by an input function, such as `read_csv()`. In other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen above, the default is to display the first and last 30 rows and truncate everything in between, as indicated by the ellipsis (`...`). Although it is truncated, this output is still quite space consuming. To glance at how the data frame looks, it is sufficient to display only the top (the first 5 lines) using the `head()` method.\n"
